Thanks for the reply!

So that would mean basically only one change in vscode: allow URLs instead of only paths.
This looks like the place to start, since it looks like the path setting gets locked down to a path here. https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/94c9ea46838a9a619aeafb7e8afd1170c967bb55/extensions/html-language-features/client/src/customData.ts#L53 (analogously for css).
Looking at the code, this also explains why reloading actually takes place when the settings are changed (as opposed to when the file pointed to in the settings changes)


The second part would be to create an extension that actually contributes `customData` as a url to a virtual document which document it provides itself dynamically via document content provider API, correct?
